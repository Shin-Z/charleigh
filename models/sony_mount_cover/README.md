## Overview

Don't like the orange mount ring on Sony alpha cameras? Now these ring covers are ready for you! 

The mount covers snapped onto the Sony alpha mirrorless cameras, just to change the orange ring to the color you like.

Currently available models: α7R(theoretically compatible to α7), α7R IV(theoretically compatible to α7 III and α7S III)

NOTE: These mount covers are small and thin, using SLA 3d printers is highly recommended.

Use and test with caution!

I can not guarantee the full compatibility of printed models, the use of all models in this project is at your own risk.

## Known Issues

- The cover on α7R(α7) might be hard to take off.

- The stiffener part near the lens release button may have conflict with some lens or converters, Techart LM-EA9 converter is currently what I found, but generally works perfectly with original Sony E mount lens

Let me know if you found any other issues, I will try to fix it: shin.zheng@foxmail.com

Happy hacking.
